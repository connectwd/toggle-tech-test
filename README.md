# Assuptions
1. Made guess as to how multiple questions should be displayed
2. Assumed the answer selected on initial load should not be randomised

# Limitations
1. In wanting to restrict the project to tools I know, I wasnt fully able to replicate the desired transition affects using tailwind alone.
2. questions transition not as 'pretty' as I would like but current solution allows for good differentiation between each question.
