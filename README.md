# toggle-tech-test
Tech test for display multiple choice question with answers.
Once an answer is correct, it will lock.
Background colour changes as the user passes 50% correctness then again at 100%
Questions take up whole page and stack so the user can scroll between them.
Page is responsive and flexible down to below 320px

# Technology used
- Nextjs framework
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Jest

# Assuptions
1. Made guess as to how multiple questions should be displayed
2. Assumed the answer selected on initial load should not be randomised

# Limitations
1. In wanting to restrict the project to tools I know, I wasnt fully able to replicate the desired transition affects using tailwind alone.
2. questions transition not as 'pretty' as I would like but current solution allows for good differentiation between each question.
